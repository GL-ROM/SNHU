# Analysis and Design

### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial wanted to create an application in which their clients could use to make decisions on their financial. The client is a big financial firm/ investing giant. They wanted us to focus on security of their application. 

### What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I was able to break down which dependencies required updating and which had vulnerabilities that needed to be checked. This was important due to the fact that it would be easy to over look this. Security is a huge implementation and passes the peace of mind from the supplier onto the clients. This means if we know we are secure, then our users will feel the same. 

### What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

It was challenging finding out the false positives. It can get difficult to read the logs and do the research as there are many cases for each dependency. Sifting through the vast amount of information was tedious but I can see it being needed. 

### How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I was able to implement encryption on several layers of the application as a test case and it worked out great. I was able to hash out information and retrieve said information with no issues. I was also able to setup in HTTPS for a more secure connection and transfer.  

### How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Testing testing testing. Always have to test and ensure that we are on the same page with security. I was able to fix any issues and small cracks by testing and reading carefully. Researching the error codes also helped tremendously. 

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Dependency testing was something I enjoyed and will be doing more of in my projects. 

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would definitely want to showcase my thoroughness of project one to get the proper codes back and point out the major issues.
