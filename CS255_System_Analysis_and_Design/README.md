### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass wanted a system in which users can register for an account and have the choices in their driver education. They wanted to provide a one stop shop to get users ready to take their DMV road exams and practicals. They wanted to provide in person driving lessons as well as online courses to study.

### What did you do particularly well?

I believe I was able to grab the requirements well from the transcript and understand fully what the stakeholders were looking for without direct contact with them.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would improve about the class diagram and get a bit more granular with the breakdown of each class. I would revisit the inheritance of each class and where exactly they would be implemented. I would also go into detail about how each class interacted with each other within that document to be a bit more clear overall. 

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I was able to grab what they wanted via the transcript and implement what was being asked. A big desire of theirs was the reporting function and I made sure to make that important when going over the designs. I saw it as an opportunity to shore up the security as well as it goes hand in hand with it. The user needs are important because you want to build a system that enables them to get what they desire out of it with little effort. You want them to keep coming back to the system and using what was designed and made for them. A bad experience can destroy a business and that is why its so important to keep in mind user needs. 

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I think designing software is best done with the big picture in mind. Approach the problem abstractly, don't even think about code, but think about what is being asked and what needs to get done. Get everything down before even thinking about writing a single line of code. Go through it a few times and design on using pen and paper if needed. Get visual aids and really break it down to its components. Once that is done then the more detailed coding side can be implemented. I think the overall process of designing a system fits this narrative and would continue to follow along with this methodology.
