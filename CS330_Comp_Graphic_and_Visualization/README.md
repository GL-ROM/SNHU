## How do I approach designing software?

Piecewise has been the best way I found to approach developing software. Grab the main points and build out the idea before any code is thought of. This way you have the pieces you need that can be broken down into code much later on. 

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

3D visualization has been essential in these projects. Being able to visualize an object in 3D space helps to organize the scenes and placement of the objects. There is no way around it so better start getting used to it as it helped me tons. 

## What design process did you follow for your project work?

I tried to get a bit done every chance I got but I quickly found that it would take a lot of time when troubleshooting. The errors and getting things to compile took much longer than working on the objects within the code. 

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I have definitely learned to not underestimate the complexity of visual projects and the shear power of openGL. This was a tough course and I would recommend sinking more time than thought into tougher subjects such as this. 

## How do I approach developing programs?

With programs or one shot type of deals, I tend to do a similar approach where I look for the grand goal and build down from there. I put the pieces together where it would be needed and work piecewise testing as I go. 

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I probably iterated more so on this project than any other I have in the past. This was a great experience and an eye opener. 

## How did iteration factor into your development?

I iterated over and over and over, which was extremely helpful as it all eventually came together. It all made sense at one point which I am happy for. 

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I made sure to build off of successful processes. I kept building off that work and built momentum to get to the point I needed to. 

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science is a beautiful world of combining practical science with the imagination. We are able to build entire worlds from simple numbers and it is inspiring. 

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I can overcome something I had no clue about and now have a deeper interest in overall. This excites me to no end and I want to push further. 

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Maybe this is a pathway I can look into in the future or even for a hobby. Something I can sink my teeth into and really challenge myself. I want to ge better and more efficient and this was the gateway.
