### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Each project introduced us into a new form of data structure which we leveraged to resolve a clients issue. We were to read in a csv of data and parse through it with validation. Once the data was recieved we would test different search, sort and remove methods to test which would perform the best. These methods would be tied to different data structures such as vectors, linked lists, and binary search trees. 

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Data structures allow for an easier navigation and organization of incoming data. Not only this but it ensures that our data is consistent and we know what to expect. This also enables us to create test cases to see how it will perform under certain loads. My approach was to go piecewise and ensure each component of the known data structure functioned. If there was a search method, I would write it out and test before moving onto the next piece. I did this for each data structure and took my time understanding what what happening and how the data was flowing through it. This was especially important with the pointers and linked list as it was a common thread amongst the other data structures. 

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Taking my time and reading up on how to implement. Psuedocode was a huge help here as I was able to decipher what was needed step by step. This helped me tremendously in the coding aspect as I had a good blueprint which to build off of. When I was stuck I would take a break and step away. This helped me clear my mind of any blocks and view the problem with clear eyes once I returned. 

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I feel that this has made me understand, fully, how powerful good psuedocode can be. It really opened my eyes into what it can do and how easy it can make the job of problem solving. 

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Overall, I would say that my pseudocode and commenting have become better. I am able to clearly define a project via my comments and keep track of what is needed via psuedocode. I will also look into different data structures and effeciencies of said codes and methods a little closer now. There is a good use case for each data structure and that is something that I have aquired in this course.
