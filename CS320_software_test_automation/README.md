# CS320 Software Test Automation and QA

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Testing, testing, testing. One of the best tools at our disposal is the ability to mimic production style releases within our testing. We should be able to emulate the needs and use cases of the end users and provide test cases to ensure that the code is clean and efficient. 

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Case by case is the best way to approach user needs. Get the specifics then simplify via code. Get what needs to be done as efficiently as possible while still maintaining quality. 

#### How do I approach designing software?
I focus on listing out the requirements that are high priority and begin to chip away at the requirements. Once a baseline has been established I then go into testing and ensure that everything method and aspect is tested to ensure proper code and best practices were kept up.
