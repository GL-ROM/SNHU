# Final Assignment for Software Development Lifecycle
# Sprint Review & Retrospective

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Using user stories helped me break down the requirements into more managable chunks that I could then create test cases for in one swoop. Meaning I was able to go from request to testing phase by breaking down
the requirements into more managable bits using those stories. I had a clear begin and end point when doing this. 

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I hope to keep using a form of user stories to chunk down by bigger projects. Focus on smaller portions that I can test without diving into too much code and then bogging myself down with errors.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Accountability and transparency. If you don't know how to accomplish a goal, let the team know. Someone might know how to do it and will share that knowledge with you and then you can pay it forward
when someone seeks help in something you would know.
