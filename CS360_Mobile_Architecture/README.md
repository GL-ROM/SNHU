### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app was created to track the users weight by date and have a running list to keep a record of progress. The needs were to have a one stop place where a user can track their weight goals journey. 

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

There were a few screens required, the login/signup screen, the main page which is the bread and butter of the application. This page showed all the user data and allowed the user to input new entries. The settings page which would let them change notifications settings and a simple page to add the data for a new entry. I kept it very simple and to the point. There was no real need to get granular with a simple application. I felt that the more intuitive and simple the design the easier it would be for a user to jump right in and use it. 

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

This was a process of trial and error. Once I was able to crack in how to get user login and authentication running with a DB everything else fell into place. I was able to get what I needed from the DB and work from there. I took my time and tested where I could although I wish I had more time to flesh out what I really wanted to do. 

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

Emulation software within android studio is invaluable, it helped me diagnose issues and test how the look and feel would go for the project throughout iterations. 

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had a hard time locking down UI elements to get the feel right where I wanted it to be. I kept changing my mind frequently and it slowed me down a lot. This is something I will keep in mind in teh future and hopefully fades as my familiarity increases. 

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I was really happy with how the user login/signup came along and helped me develop a deeper understanding of how each component works with each other. I was able to clone a lot of that integration into other aspects of the application.
