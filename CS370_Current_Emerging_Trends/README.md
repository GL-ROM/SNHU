# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this treasure hunt game we were given some boiler plate code to get started with a Q learning pathfinding AI. The objective was to get the pirate to find the treasure before the human player did. We were tasked with writing the bulk of the implementation code where we would loop through plays in order to find the optimal path leveraging reinforcement learning. 

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

They make life efficient. Thats what I believe, we look to create solutions to newer problems. Innovate the best they can and change the way things work, hopefully for the better. The future is tech and we will need the scientist and tech heads to help lead the way. 

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

In pieces. I think the best way to approach a problem is if you are able to break it down into simpler smaller chunks.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ethics and morals should be at the forefront of any project being made. Without that we leave not only our end users vulnerable but our organizations and ourselves. There needs to be ethical discussions in every decision made that effects the client base.
