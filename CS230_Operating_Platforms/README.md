# Software Design Document

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was "The Gaming Room" a company that made interactive games. Their request was to create a game titled "Draw it, or Lose it" in which teams competed to guess the image before the timer ran out. It was meant to run across multiple platforms and reach as many users as possible. This was designed to be a web application.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Keeping the information concise and to the point. I believe that it is important especially in technical documentation to be as precise and concise as possible.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I really found it helpful to organize my thoughts and see exactly what was required in the code. Having a document to look back and keep me on task was extremely helpful to me as I tend to dive into the rabbit hole once I begin coding with a goal in mind. This kept me on track and focused on what needed to get done minus the fluff. 

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the recommendations a bit more. I would wait until I have a bit more hands on experience with a few more systems and setups before giving my final verdict and recommendation. In a perfect world I would get to play in a sandbox of each of the operating systems and see the "look and feel" as well as performance of each before making my final call. Since most of my hands on experience had been with windows, that was the one I went with. 

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I created stories of which was needed. Something I found helpful in learning about agile development. It helped me breakdown the asks into manageble testable chunks that I could iterate over. This helped me keep track and on task with bite sized increments of what needed to get done. 

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I think I would be more focused on the platform I was intending on using right off the bat. This way I can save time on the comparison of each platforms. This would only be if the project allowed that. I would then follow up with breaking down the project into smaller more managable and testable sections keeping in mind what was asked. Focused on making progress in key portions of the application and then using the documentation as a master check list of what was done and what needed to get done. Almost monolithic in nature but it could be adapted to an agile setup.
